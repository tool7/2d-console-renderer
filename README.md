# Basic 2D Console Renderer
Simple renderer that outputs ASCII characters to the console, written in C without any external libraries.
<br/>
I've implemented the classic **Snake** game using it (the code is in the `/src/game/snake.c` file).

### Prerequisites:
- Having `gcc` installed

### How to run it:
1. Clone or download the repository and navigate to it via the terminal
2. Run the `make` command (it outputs the executable under the `/build` folder)
3. Run `./build/program.exe`
